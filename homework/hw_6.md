## Exercise 16
### Perfect numbers
Write a program that calculates which integers below 1000 are perfect numbers. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself.

> **Hint:**<br>
> The first perfect number is 6. Its proper divisors are 1, 2 and 3 `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.<br>
> The next perfect number is 28: `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`.<br>
> 8 is not a perfect number because it is evenly divisible by 1, 2 and 4 but `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`.
